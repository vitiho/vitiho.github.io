> *What is this page?*. This page is basically a placeholder for the main landing page of vitiho.com domain. The obvious question is why would you put an effort to learn jekyll and then write this whole page creating just another completely useless landing page on the internet? And few other follow up questions would be, what can I expect to find here? And how often will it be updated?

Well, here I'll give it a shot trying to answer those three questions.

## Why another usless landing page?

The main driving force as with everything is learning something new, now why I picked jeckyll and github pages is pretty obvious, both are completely free so being cheap and picking where to put my landing page I've picked obviously a free hosting. I don't expect to update it often (if ever), and the domain since (pretty shameful and financially damaging) expiration this year is renewed for next 10 years.
